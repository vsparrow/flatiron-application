            <h2>Why code?</h2>
            <h3>Writing code will be as fundamental as writing on a peice of paper or typing. Those who cannot code will be left behind. With the rise of Internet-of-things (IoT), Virtual reality, 3-d printing, and robotics automation, the future will be dictated by those who can translate their will to and instruction set. In 1997 you had to call to get a pizza, go to Barnes & Nobles to get a book, and refer to the dewey decimal system to get information. Today all that can be done in the palm of your hand. I want to be part of the next 20 years, guiding technology rather than be made obselecent by it. </h3>
            <h2>Why choose Flatiron School On-Campus?</h2>
            <h3>As an extroverted individual, I thirive much better in a live environment where I can bounce ideas and questions of others. Online learning is a bit impersonal, and  while it does have advantages, lacks a quality thaat being ith like-minded indivudlas gives you. People like TIm Ferriss, Tai Lopez, and Tony RObbins all talk about hte importance of coaches to help yu come futher in a few months that might otherwise take you years. I beleive FLatiron can give me that advantage</h3>
            <h2>How would Mohammad make the Flatiron experiance better for everyone involved?</h2>
            <h3>Coming from a technical background, and haveing done a lot of self-study already, I would be coming in at 50/100 rather than the 20/100 other students might be. I would be glad to help others in my cohort as being able to help would also bring a deeper understanding to myself. I realzie that even in an in-person environemnt, learning programming is stil self study. If the cohor is a space shuttle, and Flatiron is the Saturn V rocket, I would love to be the thrusters that helps the cohort achive orbit in programming space.</h3>
            <h2>What does Mohammad hope to achive by completing the in person course?</h2>
            <h3>I already have a good understanding of programming, but I believe myself to lack a certain polish that Flatiron can provide.The gem is there, it just needs to be cut i the right shape.</h3>
