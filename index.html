            <h2>Why code?</h2>
            <h3>Writing code will be as fundamental as writing on a piece of paper or typing. With the rise of Internet-of-things (IoT), Virtual reality, 3D printing, and robotics automation, the future will be dictated by those who can translate their will into an instruction set. In 1997 you had to call to get a pizza, go to Barnes & Nobles to get a book, and refer to the dewey decimal system to get information. Today, 20 years later,  all that can be done in the palm of your hand. Where will we be in another 20? I want to be part of the magic, creating gifts that not only make my life, but the lives of others better. </h3>
            <h2>Why choose Flatiron School On-Campus?</h2>
            <h3>As an extroverted individual, I thrive much better in a live environment where I can bounce ideas and questions of others. Online learning is a bit impersonal, and while it does have advantages, it lacks a quality that being with like-minded individuals gives you. People like TIm Ferriss, Tai Lopez, and Tony Robbins all talk about the importance of coaches and peers to help you come further in a few months that might otherwise take you years alone. I believe Flatiron can give me that advantage of overcoming coding obstacles.</h3>
            <h2>How would Mohammad make the Flatiron experiance better for everyone involved?</h2>
            <h3>Coming from a technical background, and having done a lot of self-study already, I would be coming in at 50/100 rather than the 20/100 other students might be. I would be glad to help others in my cohort, as being able to help would also bring a deeper understanding to myself. If the cohort is a space shuttle, and Flatiron is the Saturn V rocket, I would love to be the thrusters that helps the cohort achieve orbit in programming space.</h3>
            <h2>What does Mohammad hope to achive by completing the in person course?</h2>
            <h3>I already have a self-study experience with programming, but I believe myself to lack a certain polish that Flatiron can provide.The gem is there, it just needs to be cut i the right shape.</h3>
